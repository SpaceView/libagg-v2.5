This is libagg v2.5.
Agg is widely used for many open source packages, such as python matplotlib.
I got studied this lib many years ago, cannot remember where it is  coming from.
Somehow I find that it is difficult to get a correct download site today, maybe lots of people don't use this old archived libagg anymore; thus I put this lib here for  those who are eager to get an archived copy!

You can use cmake + vs2017 or cmake + vs2019 to compile this  project. is has no dependency on any other libraries, and works well with the latest development systems.
